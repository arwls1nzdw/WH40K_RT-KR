The inspector's writ got lost somewhere in the bowels of the planetary Administratum and was lying there this whole time, but they made sure to remember to tack on the fines every month. By the time they found the blasted paper and finally informed me... the total sum was so obscene it would take three generations of my descendants, if I had any, to pay it off. My fate was sealed: trial, sentence, prison. All because of some daft rotter who shoved my paper in the wrong box!\nTo be fair, I think I got off pretty easy. My bed in the barracks is about as hard as that slab o' rockcrete I've got at home, working in the quarry isn't much tougher than my old job, and the rules... void take me, that old sod that governs Rykad Minoris is a bloody sadist by comparison!\nIt's a strange old place. I haven't been beaten once yet. The guards bark orders all the time, but they never hit us. They also got this kind of inner circle of special 'chosen' prisoners. The Optimatum, they call it. If you can get in, Emperor as my witness, you get an actual day off! They let you out of your cell and into the yard by the big barracks. And, I tell you what, they let you rest there and feed you better than whatever swill they're giving us in the canteen. They told me it's to improve our motivation and all that — to foster a stronger desire to reform and become a worthy servant of the Imperium once more. But I know it for what it is — just a club for the warden's favourites. The same story as everywhere else: suck up to the people in power and get some swanky perks.\nThey say the whole thing was the warden's idea. Funny man, our warden. He looks more noble than nobility itself: tall, groomed, teeth even, eyes burning, boots so polished you can see yourself when you move to lick 'em. But that nutter doesn't much want people licking his boots. He walks around looking like he's deep in thought, all right, with only a couple of guards at his side, and he sometimes — if you can believe it — talks to prisoners. What's your name, he asks 'em all quiet-like. Why were you condemned? Do you feel remorse? He never even yells at no one, never orders to have 'em flogged. Instead, he doles rewards out to the special ones. Keeps telling us things like how we should strive to make society believe in us again.\nUh-huh. Whatever you say, Master Warden! Starting tomorrow, I'll be trying to join these 'optimates' of yours. I'm stuck in here till the day I die, and that means no return to society for me — but, with the Emperor's help, I might just join the ranks of the local elite!\"",

He's the reason I'm in this hole.\nDon't know what they threw him in for, but I've never felt better in my life. He's not just behind the same bars as me, he's fresh meat, and I'm a venerable optimate respected by everyone in the colony.\nThe warden just came up with a new improvement: from now on, anyone who underperforms, misbehaves, or causes trouble any other way is to be punished by the 'community.' Specifically, by the local best and brightest. Yours truly, the optimates!\nThe last two sods who failed to meet the quota were stripped naked, whipped, and thrown into cages in the big barracks.

I thought everyone else was doing the same, nodding just to please the big man.\nI was wrong. After that, people in the barracks started yapping on about purgation and blindness too.

Assigned name: tech-blight.\nEffect: The tech-blight is capable of corroding matter and destroying it from within at a terrifying speed. This deadly plague infects mechanisms as well as any metals and other materials used as their basis. No technology known to the crimson priesthood — neither gifts from the great Omnissiah nor heretical products of xenos — can withstand this onslaught. The disease poisons and warps the very essence and taints the code of sacred mechanisms.\nObservations: The tech-blight triggers an effect that is repulsive at its core: it transforms metals into horrific forms of an unpredictable nature. During testing, it demonstrated the ability to fuse solid matter with organic objects, creating something new as a result. The phenomenon was assigned the name 'tech-splicing.'\nMethod of transportation: ceramic capsules. Burnt clay is the only thing that can contain the pestilence. Extra caution must be taken given the containers' fragility. Any damage might result in an uncontrolled outbreak. Damaging the containers is _UNACCEPTABLE_.\nCurrent stage: Tests to subjugate the tech-blight to His will and turn it into a weapon subject to the Omnissiah's wisdom. Test result assessment: success.\nNote: The tests triggered an event recorded under the name Incident N872-04. The Quest for Knowledge in His name will continue.\nHypothesis 1: The tech-blight was created in the darkness of unknown worlds. Away from the eye of the Great Creator.\nHypothesis 2: Any taint that exists to harm the Machine God's creations can and will be bent to His will.\"",

Each of us is born to realise one supreme purpose — to lead Humanity to perfection through our example, perfection which the lesser beings have forgotten in the endless cycle of war and service. Only by attending to their physical, intellectual, and spiritual needs can an Aristocrat fully devote themselves to that for which they were born — creative passions, whether that be the fine arts, the written word, government, or other more refined spheres of worldly knowledge. An Aristocrat's passion is in itself a virtue and the highest good.\nAn Aristocrat must satisfy these needs by any means open to them. Nothing stimulates a weary mind like fine amasec, a good flogging, or enjoyment of carnal pleasures with women, men, and animals. In the thrill of passion, an Aristocrat is at liberty to torture or maim the object of their desire. If the clergy frown upon such an act, repent, atone for the apostasy with jewels, and forgive them their closed minds, for only an Aristocrat is given to understand that such acts are in service of a grand purpose.\nShould an Aristocrat deliberately curtail their own desires in some way and fail to appreciate the gifts granted them as one of nature's higher beings, then in what way do they differ from the dust beneath one's feet, from the mindless beast, or from the crude, deceitful, useless rabble? Such a pretender is an agonising stain on our noble society, and it behoves every True Aristocrat to return our lost brother to the fold or to stamp out his contemptible life as gladly as we might crush a vexatious bug beneath our boot.\"",

Its author was documenting the events of his life with thoroughness bordering on obsession. After browsing through its pages, the following entries catch your attention:\n{br}\n\"Exodus. Watch 1.\nNever thought this day would come — I'm addressed as 'master captain' once more. How many times did I swear never to venture into the void again during those two Terran years I spent among the mangled ruins of the Unheralded Reckoning's bridge? Unfortunately, life in a gravity well didn't bring me peace.\nReverend Hieronymus promised me that performing a selfless feat of devotion would bring me serenity. Maybe he's right. But I'm still writing in this journal during the long nights to keep my sanity. Just like I did for two years There and seven Terran years after that Here. We'll see if I'll be able to live without the Somewhere that is our Void Wanderer's destination.\n{br}\nExodus. Watch 237.\nThe crew has reported hearing strange noises from the ventilation shafts for a third time. Alas, I'm charged with pilgrims, not seasoned voidsmen: the venture scares them, and they've already managed to make up their share of absurd ghost stories. I asked Reverend Gravik to calm them down. He's the official head of the pilgrimage, so they ought to listen to him.\n{br}\nExodus. Watch 240.\nThe vent inspection is finished. Just as expected, there was nothing to worry about, just some torn tubing striking the hull.\n{br}\nExodus. Watch 393.\nReverend Hieronymus was wrong. Faith does not bring me peace. I prefer not to take any sides in the theological dispute that has broken out aboard our vessel, ignoring the debates altogether. I'll let Reverend Gravik handle it. I'm slightly concerned about this schism, but as long as both groups are peaceful and agree to follow my orders, they can bicker and shout all they want.\n{br}\nExodus. Watch 810.\nThe Great Day has arrived. The Void Wanderer has successfully landed on the planet's surface. I wonder if it'll ever leave it.\nA settlement is already being built down the hill. Its official colonial designation is AIII-649-Minoris, but Reverend Gravik said he's going to name it Jesevon.\nWhen we first stepped onto the surface, Reverend Gravik's congregation and the Nourishers used different airlocks to leave the vessel. Seems like they've ceased any and all communication.\n{br}\nExodus. Watch 1212.\nToday the last pilgrims left the Wanderer for Jesevon. I'm alone once again. They invited me to go with them, but I made up an excuse about needing to keep watch at the reactor since my ship is still used for powering the settlement. Truth be told, I just didn't want to go with them.\nThey say less than a thousand pilgrims are still loyal to Gravik. The services at the main temple are performed by the Nourishers, and the Saint Drusus statue is cut only up to its knees. I can't understand their beliefs, but I don't think they will help me more than Reverend Hieronymus's faith.\n{br}\nExodus. Watch 1287.\nI was awoken in the night by a dozen pilgrims from Jesevon. They were armed and scared and said the Nourishers had arrested Reverend Gravik.\nThey were bewildered and didn't know what to do, wanting me to act. So act I did. Since Reverend Gravik is the official head of the pilgrimage, I deemed this an incident of civil unrest. I cut power to Jesevon and demanded Reverend Gravik's release via vox-comm.\nWe are holding the line.\n{br}\nExodus. Watch 1290.\nThe Nourishers have come to us. Gravik was with them. He was calm and said that the conflict had been resolved. He took the confused pilgrims and their guns with him, and I restored power to the settlement.\nI have no idea what's going on.\n{br}\nPeace. The watch is of no consequence.\nToday I received the brotherly kiss, and now I Believe. I can clearly see the spiral path among the stars set for us by the Emperor-Progenitor. Now I can hear my brothers and sisters. I am finally alone no more.\"",

The majority perished of blood loss within a day of being placed in the laboratory chamber due to the inability to halt the discharge of ocular secretions (tears) and the body's subsequent replacement of these secretions with the connective tissue of its internal environment. The individuals with the greatest resistance to the sacred Child's resonance died several chrono-turns later: extensive wounds in the abdomen, presumably inflicted by a jagged piece of metal; death was caused by strangulation with the subjects' own intestines. The subjects' final shouts exhibited concerns over abominable tentacles and void worms, hallucinations prescribed to their own internal organs.{br}\nExperiment H4545-2\nSubgroup: lowborn, female\nThe test subjects died within an hour of entering the laboratory adjacent to the Child's chambers. Most had their tongues bitten off or their jaws badly dislocated: some test subjects lacked the physical strength to separate it from the rest of the skull. Cause of death: severe head injuries caused by impacting the walls or the floor.{br}\nExperiment H4545-3\nSubgroup: a paralysed patient who lost the ability to speak due to the shock caused by a manufactorum accident, male\nThe test subject noted a tingling sensation in the deteriorated tissue. During Regent Aaronto Orsellio's visit to the Child, the test subject smiled and started humming (most likely trying to carry some plebeian tune) and then attempted to address the servant who brought him food. A lengthy conversation was prohibitive due to the servant's lack of a tongue.{br}\nExperiment H4545-4\nSubgroup: a defective offspring of Lord P. Orsellio, pronounced unfit for studying the high art of Navigation owing to the mutation of tissues required for installation of the obligatory augmentations that merge one's consciousness with the vessel, additionally they display an overall feebleness of mind, female\nThe test subjects mirrored the Child's actions for three days. On the fourth day the Child became upset after hearing the news about the untimely demise of Amos Cantarelli, an officer of her personal guard. As a result, one of the test subjects peeled away several layers of tissue from her face and died from the resulting massive heart attack.\nThe last surviving test subject was executed for attempting to contact the Child.",

For we are created in the God-Emperor's image to carry His light, and His will, and His word into the galaxy both in life and after our passing.\n- Glory!\n- Glory to the Lord of Humanity whose envoys, women and men of courage and virtue, guide our sons and daughters to the only path that is righteous.\n- Glory!\n- May your souls weep and lament your ignorance of how to love our God-Emperor, the Warden of Light, more than He loves each and every one of us. Cry, pray, repent, and beg for forgiveness, for your love is no love at all. Your great love is infinitely small. And even the most profound love of His most loyal servants is infinitesimally less than the love that the Master of Mankind gives us in return.\n- Glory to the Immortal One!\n- Now let us talk about how we can love the Emperor's flesh and spirit even more, and how to come closer to His divine immortality in life and after we die.\"\nRustling and whispering are heard again, and the recording ends.",

The older chronicles tell of a bleak historical period of the tribe's decline due to an unknown virus. The symbols on the canvas resemble High Gothic letters, but the inhabitants do not know the origin of their meaning, claiming that the sacred knowledge was bestowed upon them by Quetza Temer himself. This character, revered as a god, obviously originates from the Imperium that we know, his exact name either lost or adapted in accordance to the local phonetics. The only other sacred symbol the tribe reveres is the Aquila — the \"Two-Headed Eagle-God.\"\nA group of the most interesting canvases depicting tragic, yet heroic deeds, was confiscated and taken on board for further investigation. Many of the words made up from the scrambled Gothic symbols were easy to decipher, such as \"banished,\" \"sacrifice,\" \"valley\" (or \"land\"/\"lands\"), as well as \"death,\" \"incomprehensible,\" and \"merciful.\" This part most likely talks about some sort of sacrificial pilgrimage.\nA priest has confirmed my theory: any tribesmen who have committed an offence can atone by sacrificium — a journey to the Deadlands, full of \"unknown deaths.\"\nThe Adepts that I have sent to investigate the Deadlands have not returned yet.{br}\nEnd of log.",
