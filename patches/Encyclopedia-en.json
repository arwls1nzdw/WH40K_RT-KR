When a torpedo salvo collides with a target, each remaining torpedo in the salvo attacks it with the same chance of successfully hitting the target as a regular ship weapon would have. If the torpedo hits, it explodes, dealing high damage but only to the target itself. If the torpedo misses, it detonates outside the target's hull, dealing reduced area damage both to the target and all other objects in a 1-cell radius. Torpedoes can also be detonated manually using a self-destruct command, resulting in the effect as when a torpedo misses its target.",
