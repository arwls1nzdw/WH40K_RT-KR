Heinrix van Calox, a sanctioned psyker in the service of the Holy Order of the Emperor's Inquisition, is bestowed with many titles and considerable powers, which he directs toward one goal â€” the fight against the enemies of Humankind.\nVan Calox is aboard the von Valancius voidship by order of the Lord Inquisitor. In his battle against servants of the Archenemy who threaten the Koronus Expanse with untold calamity, Heinrix is ready to sacrifice the remains of his own humanity, but if he does, will he then be any different from the monsters he fights?"
