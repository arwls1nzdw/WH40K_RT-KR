Ulfar set foot on the warpath many decades ago, and a trail of blood has stretched out behind him ever since. He enters every battle with a triumphant howl, for there is no fear of death for one whose saga will be reverently sung by his brothers in the Hall of the Great Wolf. His violent temper and boyish desire for glory and boasting have not been cooled by his years of fighting nor by his ordeal of being held captive in the Dark City of Commorragh. Having joined the Rogue Trader's retinue, Ulfar has resumed the writing of his saga in the Koronus Expanse, and the enemies of Humanity tremble at the sound of his battle cry.",
