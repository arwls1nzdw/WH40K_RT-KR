    "30cc7b2c-8e3b-4bfd-9462-f0dc19765572": "Idira Tlass is a psyker diviner in the service of Rogue Trader von Valancius. Daughter of a distant world and a product of a doctrine alien to the Imperium, she perceives the curse of sorcery as a gift she deserves — for only the most skilled and strong can endure the touch of the Immaterium.\nYears of using her sorcerous powers have cost both Idira's mind and soul dearly. With each passing day, her ability to keep the malignant forces under control weakens, and so the moment when the warp will devour the diviner without a trace creeps ever closer. Who knows if Idira will be able to come to terms with the inevitable — or if she will turn to other forbidden forces in search of salvation?"
