A unique Navigator gene allows her to guide Humankind's voidships through the warp, gazing fearlessly into the depths of the Sea of Souls. The price for this incredible gift is terrifying mutations that devour the girl's fragile body, further alienating her from Humankind.\nAfter surviving an assassination attempt on the station Eurac V, Cassia found herself in a Rogue Trader's crew much sooner than her mentors ever expected. Years spent studying tomes and maps failed to prepare the girl for the challenges of the outside world, and of her own Navigator House, which is being torn apart by a power struggle for the Novator's throne.",
