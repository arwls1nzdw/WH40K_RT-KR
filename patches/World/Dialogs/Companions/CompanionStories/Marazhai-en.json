    "5035ffb1-fe81-4f43-9562-84cb4f8b3ef1": "Marazhai Aezyrraesh, Dracon of the Kabal of the Reaving Tempest, is the embodiment of all the true qualities of the Drukhari, the most brutal and deadly branch of the Aeldari. He is driven by an unquenchable thirst for violence and power over others, which he achieves through subtle cunning, dubious deals, and — to his great delight — the slaughter and torture of his enemies. A fateful encounter with the Rogue Trader changes his fate forever: stripped of everything that once was his by right, the former Dracon and exile of Commorragh is now forced to ally with one of the \"mon-keigh\" to survive... and perhaps to find a new way to rise again."
